# Test Suite for Text JSON (TJSON) - a readability optimized, round trip compatible alternative to JSON

## Platform-Neutral Tests

A conforming parser must pass all the parsing tests.

Generators may not have the same options as the reference implementation, and may fail some of the generator tests without necessarily being out of specification.  If you are generating something that doesn't parse with the reference implementation, and you think it is spec compliant, please make sure to report it as a bug against the reference implementation.  The reference parser is supposed to fail most (but not all) invalid TJSON.

Generators by definition have a lot of choices that they can make within the TJSON specification.  That's one of the goals of the project.  Don't let these tests bind you to generate TJSON that looks like the reference implementation, but also don't assume that just because it parses it's a good idea to generate it.

The reference implementation uses this repository as a subrepo for testing, but that is not it's only purpose.  It is meant to be generally useful to anyone that wishes to implement TJSON.

# Text JSON (TJSON)

## Why Text JSON (TJSON)?

Humans read from screens in squares.  Computers read character by character, ignoring linefeeds, making JSON look just fine, but any attempt to turn JSON into normal text generally looks like a thin line passing through the screen going down to infinity.  Pretty printing helps, but it can't address many of the core readability problems.  This is my attempt to fix that.

## Specification

The full specification is in [tjson-specification.md](tjson-specification.md).

## Reference Implementation

[TJSON reference implementation written in Rust](https://github.com/rfanth/tjson/)
The TJSON reference implementation includes a full featured binary and library.  The library compiles with musl, and has WASM compatibility for use in webpages.
